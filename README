KVM (Kernel Virtualization Moduel) plays critical role in the present data
center environment, especially when virtualization is needed. When KVM is
adopted, there are several components to be included: Host, KVM, VMM (QEMU)
and guest. The application runs on top of guest OS. The requests from the
applications can take long journey before they're completed. For example,
the application's request can be sent to guest OS, KVM and then QEMU, where
the request is emulated and completed.

Sometimes, long journey means clumsy and low performance. So here I attempt
to simplify the design by combing QEMU and guest OS into one, which is named
as "sandbox". Presumablely, there are several tasks need to be done in the
sandbox, in order to accommodate the running applications.

  * Application startup, shutdown and packaging.

  * System call services.

  * CPU, memory, filesystem and networking.

Obviously, the project is huge and needs tremendous invests. I'm taking this
as a hobby project. So the invested time isn't guranteed and comitted. For
more information and design, please refer to the documents in 'doc' directory.
